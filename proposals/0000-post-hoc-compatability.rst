Proposal title
==============

Here you should write a short abstract motivating and briefly summarizing the
proposed change.

Motivation
----------

Here you should describe in greater detail the motivation for the change. This
should include concrete examples of the shortcomings of the current
state of things.

Proposed Change
---------------

Here you should describe in precise terms what the proposal seeks to change.
This should cover several things,

* define the scope of the change, what does it affect? cabal? stack? a web site?
* define the intended operations of the new change
* discuss how the change addresses the points raised in the Motivation section
* discuss how the proposed approach might interact with existing features  

Note, however, that this section need not describe details of the
implementation of the feature. The proposal is merely supposed to give a
conceptual specification of the new feature and its behavior.

Drawbacks
---------

What are the reasons for *not* adopting the proposed change. These might include
complicating the language grammar, poor interactions with other features, 

Alternatives
------------

Here is where you can describe possible variants to the approach described in
the Proposed Change section.

Unresolved Questions
--------------------

Are there any parts of the design that are still unclear? Hopefully this section
will be empty by the time the proposal is brought up for a final decision.
